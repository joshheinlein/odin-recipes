    <h2>A Taste of Tuscany</h2>
    <p>Hey who doesn't like soup?! We got ourselves a good one today with Zuppa Toscana</p>
    <p>Instead of boring you with a story, let's just make the damn thing!</p>
    
    <h4>INGREDIENTS</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound mild italian sausage</li>
        <li>1 1/4 teaspoons crushed red pepper flakes</li>
        <li>a bunch of other stuff!</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>STEPS</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook Italian sausage and red pepper flakes in a Dutch oven over medium-high heat until crumbly, browned, and no longer pink, 10 to 15 minutes. Drain and set aside.</li>
        <li>Cook bacon in the same Dutch oven over medium heat until crisp, about 10 minutes. Drain, leaving a few tablespoons of drippings with the bacon in the bottom of the Dutch oven. Stir in onions and garlic; cook until onions are soft and translucent, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>And many other steps!</li>
